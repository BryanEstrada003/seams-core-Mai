// Parameter file for structure factor calculation
//
// Example of a parameter file to read a lammpstrj file 
// and output the structure factor. The filename is
// given to XYZFile or trajFile as a relative path to the 
// path where the program is executed. 
// The lammps file MUST be inside a folder called traj 
// within the input folder. 
// The xyz file should be inside a folder called xyz

trajFile=./input/traj/dump-bcc.lammpstrj
// xyzFile=./input/xyz/configuration.xyz

//The neighbor radius, points are considered neighbors
//when their distance is smaller than NeighborDistance
