// Parameter file for structure factor calculation
//
// Example of a parameter file to read a lammpstrj file 
// and output the structure factor. The filename is
// given to XYZFile or trajFile as a relative path to the 
// path where the program is executed. 
// The lammps file MUST be inside a folder called traj 
// within the input folder. 
// The xyz file should be inside a folder called xyz

trajFile=./input/traj/dump-liq.lammpstrj
// xyzFile=./input/xyz/configuration.xyz

//The neighbor radius, points are considered neighbors
//when their distance is smaller than NeighborDistance

// Comment out the following lines if they are not required.
// The RDF requires the binwidth parameter to determine the 
// number of bins. There should be no spaces before or after
// the equal sign. The maximum radius upto which the RDF will be 
// calculated must also be specified. This must be less than or equal 
// to half the simulation box length. If not specified or incorrectly
// entered, the maximum radius is set by default to be half of the 
// smallest box length.
